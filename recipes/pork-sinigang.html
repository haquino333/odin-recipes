        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Preparing the Tamarind Extract</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Wash tamarind and place in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer <br>
                    skins begin to burst.
                </li>
                <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds. </li>
                <li>
                    In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning <br>
                    some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice. Discard seeds and skins.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
        <h4>Cooking Procedure</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
                <li>
                    In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that <br>
                    accumulates on top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours <br>
                    or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.
                </li>
                <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
                <li>Add the chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the string beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour tamarind juice into the pot of sinigang.</li>
                <li>Season with salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
