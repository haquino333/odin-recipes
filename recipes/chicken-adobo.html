        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish that's as savory as it is bright with acid, and it goes <br>
            perfectly with a large platter of garlic fried rice.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) cooking oil</li>
                <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken legs, separated into thighs and drumsticks (about 2 1/2 pounds; 1.15kg)</li>
                <li>8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 whole fresh bay leaves (or 3 whole dried bay leaves)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups (300ml) water</li>
                <li>1 cup (240ml) soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup (240ml) rice vinegar</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Blot chicken dry withpaper <br>
                    towels, then season lightly all over with salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work in batches if necessary, add chicken pieces to pot in a single layer, skin side down, making <br>
                    sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook until well browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken <br>
                    pieces and cook until lightly brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate <br>
                    and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to now-empty pot and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is <br>
                    very fragrant and garlic turns a light golden color, about 30 seconds. Add water and stir with a wooden <br>
                    spoon, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Add soy sauce and vinegar, return chicken <br>
                    pieces to pot, increase heat to high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer <br>
                    until chicken is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes, turning the chicken pieces halfway through. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chicken adobo is best served after sitting overnight in the refrigerator, but it can also be served <br>
                    immediately, with steamed white rice or (preferably) garlic fried rice.
