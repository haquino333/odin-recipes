                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 packs (50 pieces) total lumpia wrappers (or spring roll wrappers)</li>
                    <li>1 egg , beaten, for egg wash</li>
                    <li>Oil for frying</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine the filling ingredients in a big bowl. Use a spatula to mix it in a circular motion,
                    until everything comes together and the pork feels elastic. It might take a few minutes to 
                    get this consistency.
                </li>
                <li>Place the lumpia wrappers on a plate and cover with a damp towel to prevent from drying out.</li>
                <li>
                    Take a wrapper and lay it in front of you with the pointed edge facing up. Take a heaping 
                    tablespoon of filling and place it a few inches from the corner closest to you. Shape the 
                    filling into a 4 to 5″ (10 to 12 cm) strip. Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold 
                    the two side corners. Roll the filling parcel up so the folded edges are tucked in. Gently use 
                    your finger to press out any air bubbles and make sure the filling is sealed in tightly. Continue 
                    rolling up the filling until just before it is completely sealed. Dab the upper corner with a 
                    small amount of egg wash with your finger, then fold the filling over to finish wrapping the 
                    lumpia. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add the oil to a medium deep pan or pot so that it comes about 1″ (2.5cm) up. Heat over medium-high 
                    heat until it reaches 350°F (176°C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gently lower a few lumpia into the pan so they do not crowd the pan. Cook, flipping with a pair of 
                    tongsoccasionally, until all sides turn golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Once the lumpia are cooked, 
                    transfer to a big plate or a tray topped with a wire rack to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine all the sauce ingredients in a small pot. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Stir 
                    constantly, until the sauce is thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pour into a serving dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the lumpia with the dipping sauce as an appetizer.
                </li>
            </ol>
